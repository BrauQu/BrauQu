- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BrauQu. I am a tourism professional, photographer and audiophile, specialized in Finnish Lapland who felt in love with technology at a young age but decided to go all the way in 2020. I am in my third-year of Business Information Technology studies in Finland. I enjoy combining time in the forest and snowy hills with the digital world. I love nature, culture, music, and sports.
- ðŸ‘€ Since childhood I loved opening electronics and playing with their parts. When I bought my first smartphone I was frustrated about the amount of memory available to the user so I decided to do justice with my own hands by rooting the device, changing some internal files and modifying some folders to allocate the internal memory to a memory card. I ended up solving the original problem and customising many other internal cool features. Since then, I have been more seriously playing with gadjets and software tools.
- ðŸŒ± I have been done some web development and basic programming projects with Java, JavaScript and Python. I would love to dive deeper with some open source projects. Iâ€™m currently learning more about frameworks such as Agile, DevOps, API integrations for creating and managing different technologies using the best practices.
